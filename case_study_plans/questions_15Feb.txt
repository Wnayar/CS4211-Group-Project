The following are questions about the midterm presentation:

1. What are the required deliverables for the midterm project?

2. What are the rubrics for the midterm presentation?


The following are questions about the case study:

1. Do we model only the main rover? Or do we also model the side rovers and maybe the environment?

2. How to decide where to use reboot or call for help? Reboot then call for help?

3. Is it guaranteed that side robots will always fix main rover?

4. Can side rover can fail?

5. Will rover only move in cardinal directions? 

6. Is 0 battery allowed to indicate charging or is 1 the minimum?

7. Can we simplify the problem such that the rover charges whenever it reaches a battery life of 1? Otherwise, how do we specify the amount of battery needed between the current position and the goal? 


The following are questions about z-modelling:

1. How to model failure? (i.e. How to model transitions such as from ok state to failure state?)

2. How to verify goal reachability and capture it in z-notation?
