✅ Variables USED (in the simplified model)

currentPosition : POS (≙ ℕ × ℕ)
Used for rover navigation state; checked against obstacles; compared to goal/charger.

goal : POS (≙ ℕ × ℕ)
Used as the mission destination (Scenario 1) and to decide when mission completes.

obstacles : ℙ POS
Used to prevent collisions (SL4) and as the fixed obstacle set (simplified V2).

visionObstacles : ℙ POS
Used only to satisfy V2’s “Vision maintains position” assumption; in simplified scope we set visionObstacles = obstacles (fixed obstacles, no detection).

chargers : ℙ POS
Used for HI2 charging: rover may only charge at a charger location.

batteryLevel : 0..MAXBATTERY (modeled as ℕ bounded; Table says float)
Used for SL1 (never run out), HI1 (decide recharge), and per-move battery consumption.

recharge : BOOL
Used for HI1/HI2: when true rover diverts to charger and must stay charging until full.

chargingComplete : BOOL
Used to decide when charging ends; typically chargingComplete ↔ batteryLevel = MAXBATTERY.

atGoal : BOOL
Used to indicate goal reached and enable completion notification (G6).

failure : BOOL
Used to trigger Scenario 2: entering FailureMode and performing recovery actions (G7/SL3).

identifiedFailure : MESSAGE
Used to record what failure occurred (abstract classification) when failure happens.

command : MESSAGE
Used to represent the chosen recovery action (e.g., reboot vs request help) during failure mode.

helperID : ℕ (with constraint helperID ∈ {0,2,3}, and valid helpers {2,3})
Used for CR3: ground station dispatches helper ID; main rover authenticates arriving helper before accepting intervention.

return2NormalOperation : BOOL
Used to mark successful recovery (after reboot or authenticated help).

systemState : SYSTEMSTATE (≙ BOOL × BOOL × ℙ MESSAGE)
Used as a packaged status summary for reporting; in simplified model we mainly ensure its failure flag matches failure.

communicationData : COMMDATA (≙ ℙ MESSAGE × DATACOLLECTED × SYSTEMSTATE)
Used to model “notify completion + send data” (G6) and “notify failure mode” (G7) as bundled transmissions.


❌ Variables NOT USED (out of simplified scope)

safeLocation : POS (≙ ℕ × ℕ)
Full model’s recovery fallback location; not required by simplified requirements.

prioritisedGoals : ℙ POS
Full model supports multiple/priority goals; simplified model uses a single goal.

invalidMap : MESSAGE
MapValidator subsystem; not part of simplified scenarios 1–2 requirements.

completed : MESSAGE (as a standalone state variable)
In simplified model it’s better treated as a message value inside communicationData.messages, not a separate stored variable.

noMoreViablePlans : MESSAGE
Planner failure notification; not required because planning is abstracted away.

failureModeInvoked : MESSAGE (as a standalone state variable)
Same as completed: treated as a message value/event rather than stored variable.

noplan : BOOL
Planner failure flag; out of scope because we don’t implement full planning.

plan2C : seq POS
Explicit charger-route plan list; not required when navigation is modeled step-by-step.

plan2D : seq POS
Explicit destination-route plan list; not required when navigation is modeled step-by-step.

recheck : BOOL
WaitForHelp periodic polling/retry mechanism; optional complexity beyond simplified CR3.

GSObstacles : ℙ POS
Ground station’s obstacle set; out of scope (we assume environment obstacles are fixed and consistent).

failed2Reconnect : BOOL
Communication reconnection failure; not required by simplified requirements.
